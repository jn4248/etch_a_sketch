/////////////    FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES - IMPORTANT  /////////////////////////

= add optional 10% alpha-grading: (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example), have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it, so only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
= mouse skips if moves too fast ???
= add input box beside buttons to ask for the size of the grid .... so looks like an old calculator.
= reset the button sizes (color buttons) to px size (should then re-size with rest of app).
  >> Afterward: check to see where to put gradient (if at all).
  >> Then see if I can shrink the color-button control panel to make entire app a bit smaller and fit on screen better?
= set default size for control-buttons, so all same size (need to adjust font-size from button to button?  ie: 2 classes?)
= set 'erase" toggle as a data-erase-status instead of a global variable? (ie: on erase button?  i think that's right....check...)
= I have a note: "change label on erase button" ....I think this means show "Erase On" when toggled on and "Erase Off" when off
= Erase and On button should "Highlight" the entire button when on (a color layer with 20% alpha?)
= new button to show instructions as a hidden drop down screen?  might have trouble with z-index...how can I bring to front so doesn't squish rest of info (don't want to make everything relative/absolute like i did for the set-default-color menu).  If I do this, I could make the top section smaller, and maybe fit all on the screen better)
= After erase, only 1 global variable left....mouseStillDown....can I move this somewhere else too?
= can use "toggle" method for class, or anything else?  colors?  add / remove, with cases to check, may be safer...in case an error somewhere in code causes a flip-flop
= add a texture over the plastic part of the toy/app...ie not the screen...so if screen is red, it looks different.  

//////////////  BEAUTIFICATIN / SPACING  ///////////////////
= review css code - wher am I adding margins/padding...on containers or eleemnts? consistent? on the right elements?
= enhance control-panel backgrounds and borders
= background for entire game (picture? with etch-a-sketches?) - simple/matching background for right button-color drop down menu
= add instructions at top
= format title name (accoring to background colors...)...maybe a red shadow?
= change buttons to be px designed, so shrinks with container boxes?
= improve border on buttons, better highlighting (to work over both light and dark colors)...double borders?  outline doesn't work because outline forms on outer square box of div, and NOT the rounded courners
= go through and clarify names used for variables (can simplify and organize/group code better?)


////////////  CODE CLEANING UP THINGS ///////////////////////////
= can I re-name variables to be more clear?
= can I remove any classes, css, or variables that are unused?
= organize code....add notes to all docsuments.  Unify the notes in both js and css
= remove un-necessary classes in css
= organize listing of css entries
= clarify arguments for methods and return (ie: type and object type)...eg;  argument: tile object...return: number

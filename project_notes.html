/////////////    FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES - IMPORTANT  /////////////////////////
= defaultTileColor variable still not calling right in createGrid().  Have set to a single color now (not changeable).  Fixed drawing problem in drawOnTile()....was calling filter() instead
     of find(), (filter returned an array? instead of just one??  not sure....find out for sure why)
= if i get the defaultTileColor variable working with get/set functions (see above problem), can I do the same with a currentDrawColor?  might simplify code in other functions...instead of searching the DOM to find the button with 'button-color-selected' class....maybe is not so bad. not too many to search through, so pretty fast.
= after getting the defaultTileColor variable get/set methods working in createGrid(), add back in the second panel (to select default tile color), and get this working.
= move variables out of global scope?  into attributes?  not sure how...
= highlight the "toggle erase" button when selected (use same hightlight as color buttons somehow...currently button-highlighted is used to identivy the active color by data-type 'color')
= can use "toggle" method for class, or anything else?  colors?  add / remove, with cases to check, may be safer...in case an error somewhere in code causes a flip-flop
= add optional 10% alpha-grading: (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example), have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it, so only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
= see if you can do a second version of the grid WITHOUT using grid display layout.
= mouse skips if moves too fast ???
= add hightlihgt to "esrase" button to show if toggled one or note

//////////////  BEAUTIFICATIN / SPACING  ///////////////////
= review css code - wher am I adding margins/padding...on containers or eleemnts? consistent? on the right elements?
= fix box sizing and spacing of buttons (buttons started to show side-by-side....I think because box enlarged because of <p> element, and buttons inherited 'inline-block'...so stacked vertically if container was small enough.  Tried designating buttons as 'block' and added 'margin: auto'...this crushed vertical spacing, so added a vertical 1em part to the margin in css)
= enhance control-panel backgrounds and borders
= fix spacing in instruction box
= add a background to page


////////////  CODE CLEANING UP THINGS ///////////////////////////
= organize code....add notes to all docsuments.  Unify the notes in both js and css
= remove un-necessary classes in css
= organize listing of css entries
= clarify arguments for methods and return (ie: type and object type)...eg;  argument: tile object...return: number

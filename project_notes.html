/////////////    FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES - IMPORTANT  /////////////////////////

= add optional 10% alpha-grading: (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example), have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it, so only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
= mouse skips if moves too fast ???
= erase button: make it show "Erase On" when toggled on and "Erase Off" when off
= new button to show instructions as a hidden drop down screen?  might have trouble with z-index...how can I bring to front so doesn't squish rest of info (don't want to make everything relative/absolute like i did for the set-default-color menu).  If I do this, I could make the top section smaller, and maybe fit all on the screen better)
= wrap entire javascript as a function() or namespace (look it up) to 'protect' against global variables.  IF I do this, do I still use (document).ready()....at top?




//////////////  BEAUTIFICATIN / SPACING  ///////////////////
= review css code - wher am I adding margins/padding...on containers or eleemnts? consistent? on the right elements?
= go through and clarify names used for variables (can simplify and organize/group code better?)


////////////  CODE CLEANING UP THINGS ///////////////////////////
= can I re-name variables to be more clear?
= can I remove any classes, css, or variables that are unused?
= organize code....add notes to all docsuments.  Unify the notes in both js and css
= remove un-necessary classes in css
= organize listing of css entries
= clarify arguments for methods and return (ie: type and object type)...eg;  argument: tile object...return: number

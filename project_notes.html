    <!--___NOTES____ideas to implement_____________________________-->
    <!--

= add a background to page
= add more color buttons

= enhance control-panel backgrounds and borders
= move variables out of global scope?  into attributes?  not sure how...
= fix reset: currently adds a second grid below first.  Also, makes user re-enter size of grid. either remove prompt, or find a way to actually reset the tile colors for all tiles.
= fix spacing in instruction box
= see if you can do a second version of the grid WITHOUT using grid display layout.
= highlight the "toggle erase" button when selected (use same hightlight as color buttons somehow...currently button-highlighted is used to identivy the active color by data-type 'color')
= add optional 10% alpha-grading: (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example), have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it, so only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
= mouse skips if moves too fast ???
= organize code....add notes to all docsuments.  Unify the notes in both js and css
= remove un-necessary classes in css
= organize listing of css entries
